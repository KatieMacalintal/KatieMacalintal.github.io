    "text": "Source Code: perceptron.py\nThe perceptron algorithm is a binary classification algorithm. It works to find a hyperplane that splits the given data into their respective labels. This machine learning algorithm, however, has the limitations that it only works on linearly separable data and data separated only into two groups.\n\n\nIn our Perceptron class, we implemented a fit(X, y) algorithm, which finds the variables of weights, w, that linearly separates X, a data set of observations and their features according to their labels y, such that an element in y is either 0 or 1. In this method, we first start with a random value for w. Then while we haven’t reached a 100% classification rate and have not exceeded the maximum number of steps, we continue to tweak our w depending on if it was able to correctly classify a random point i in our data set X.\nThe update of our weights, w, is seen on line 45 of our perceptron.py code. It is equivalent to the following math equation … \\[\\tilde{w}^{(t+1)} = \\tilde{w}^{(t)} + \\mathbb{1}(\\tilde{y}_i {\\langle \\tilde{w}^{(t)}, \\tilde{x}_i\\rangle} < 0)\\tilde{y}_i \\tilde{x}_i\\]\nThis equation only updates w when our prediction for the label of \\(\\tilde{x}_i\\), the randomly selected data point, is incorrect. This is indicated through the \\(\\mathbb{1}(\\tilde{y}_i {\\langle \\tilde{w}^{(t)}, \\tilde{x}_i\\rangle} < 0)\\) portion of the equation, for it will evaulate to 0 when our w does classify the point correctly and the calcuations will not affect \\(\\tilde{w}^{(t+1)}\\), our w in the next iteration. When the indicator evaulates to 1, meaning our predication was incorrect, then our w is incremented by \\(\\tilde{y}_i \\tilde{x}_i\\). This moves our linear separator in the right direction, so that our randomly selected point could be classified correctly on the next iteration if it were selected.\n\n\n\nBefore we conduct any experiments, we need to import and define relevant extensions, classes, and functions.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\n\nnp.random.seed(12345)\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\n\n\nHere is a data set of two distinct groups with 2 features.\n\nn = 100\np_features = 2\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = n, n_features = p_features, centers = [(-1.75, -1.75), (1.75, 1.75)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the graph, it looks like the points could be separated by a line so that all the purple points, whose label would be “0,” are on one side of the line and all the yellow points, whose label would be “1,” are on the other side of the line.\nWhen we run our Perceptron fit method on this data, we can inspect it’s history of scores. We see that over time the score flucuated as w was adjusted, but it eventually reaches 100% classification. This means that the fit method eventually found the variable of weights that would allow it to create a linear separator on the given data.\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y)\nfig = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen we then graph our line using the weights our Perceptron fit method found, we see that our algorithm was indeed able to separate the data into their respective labels.\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is another data set of two distinct groups with 2 features.\n\nn = 100\np_features = 2\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = n, n_features = p_features, centers = [(0, 0), (0, 0)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nThis time, however, it does not look like we can separate the purple and yellow points from each other. Since the data points overlap, it does not look like a linear separator could separate the points into their respective labels.\nWhen looking at this set’s history of scores, we see that it too flucates. This time, however, we see that the score never reaches 1, in other words, it does not reach 100% classification. Instead, it eventually reaches the max number of times we’ll adjust w. While the Perceptron fit method still stores the last value of weights in the object, it communicates that it is not accurate as it gives the warning that the data was unable to converge.\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y)\nfig = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n/Users/katiemacalintal/Desktop/Machine Learning/KatieMacalintal.github.io/posts/perceptron/perceptron.py:51: UserWarning: WARNING: Could not converge\n  warnings.warn(\"WARNING: Could not converge\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we then graph our line using the weights the final iteration of our Perceptron fit method found, we see that, as expected, our algorithm was not able to separate the data into their expected labels. (Note: The scale of the axis may also look different)\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur perceptron algorithm can also work in more than 2 dimensions. This time we’ve created a data set of two distinct groups with 7 features.\n\nn = 100\np_features = 7\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = n, n_features = p_features, centers = [(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)])\n\nSince this is difficult to visualize, we will only be inspecting its history of scores. As we can see in the chart, our new data set is linearly separable as the score eventually reaches 1.\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y)\nfig = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can also alter this data set, so that the two groups overlap.\n\nn = 100\np_features = 7\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = n, n_features = p_features, centers = [(10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10), (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10)])\n\nAs we can see by inspecting the history of scores and the warning that is thrown, our data set never converges.\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y)\nfig = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n/Users/katiemacalintal/Desktop/Machine Learning/KatieMacalintal.github.io/posts/perceptron/perceptron.py:51: UserWarning: WARNING: Could not converge\n  warnings.warn(\"WARNING: Could not converge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of a single iteration of the perceptron algorithm update, I think the runtime complexity of our algorithm would depend on \\(p\\), the number of features. The operation that I think take the longest time would be \\({\\langle \\tilde{w}^{(t)}, \\tilde{x}_i\\rangle}\\), which I think takes \\(O(p)\\) time. There is other multiplication and addition that takes place in this equation, but since it happens consecutively it won’t matter at a larger scale. Thus, I think that runtime of the update would be \\(O(p)\\)."

    "text": "Source Code: logistic-regression.py\nIn this blog post, we use logistic regression and gradient descent to efficiently find a hyperplane that can separate a binary classified data set with minimal loss, in other words minimize the empircal risk.\n\n\nIn our LogisticRegression class, we implemented a fit and fit_stochastic function that both take the data set X and their expected labels y.\nIn the fit function, we are looking for the weights w (which includes the bias term) such that it mimimizes our loss. In order to find this w, we use the gradient descent framework with a convex loss function, which combined allows us to search for this local minima. In this framework, we compute the gradient of our loss function: \\[\\ell(\\hat{y}, y)=-y\\log\\sigma(\\hat{y})-(1-y)\\log(1-\\sigma(\\hat{y})),\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the logistic sigmoid function and \\(\\hat{y}\\) is our prediction \\(\\langle w,x_i \\rangle\\). This loss function, known as the logistic loss function, is convient for us because it is strictly convex in it’s first argument meaning that our loss can have at most one minimum. The gradient of this loss function turns out to be: \\[\\nabla L(w)=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\sigma(\\hat{y_i})-y_i)x_i.\\] This gradient equation is implemented in the gradient function of our LogisticRegressions class as\nnp.mean(((self.sigmoid(y_) - y)[:,np.newaxis]) * X, axis = 0).\nThen, as stated in Theorem 2 of Optimization with Gradient Descent notes, because our gradent is a descent direction, we adjust our w by stepping in the direction of descent, since we are looking for a w such that our loss is at the lowest it can be. We do this until we either reach the specified max_epochs or converge. In this case, convergence is until the improvement in the our loss function is small enough in magnitiude.\nThe fit_stochastic function is very similar to the fit function, expect here we don’t compute the complete gradient, we instead compute the gradient on a specified batch size. In this function, there is also the option to specify whether one would like to use momentum.\n\n\n\nBefore we conduct any experiments, we need to import and define relevant extensions, classes, and functions.\n\nfrom logistic_regression import LogisticRegression # source code\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nnp.seterr(all='ignore') \n\n# Graph fitted line and loss function\ndef graph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR):\n    fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2)\n\n    axarr[0].scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\n    axarr[0].set(xlabel = \"Feature 1\", ylabel = \"Feature 2\", title = f\"Loss = {LR.loss_history[-1]}\")\n\n    f1 = np.linspace(-3, 3, 101)\n\n    p = axarr[0].plot(f1, (- LR.w[2] - f1*LR.w[0])/LR.w[1], color = \"black\")\n\n    axarr[1].plot(LR.loss_history)\n    axarr[1].set(xlabel = \"Iteration number\", ylabel = \"Empirical Risk\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\nWe first create a set of data with 2 features and see that their labels slightly overlap with each other.\n\n# Make the data\np_features = 3\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 200, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can then fit this data using our fit method, which uses gradient descent, and fit_stochastic, which used batch gradient descent. When we give these fit methods a reasonable learning rate \\(\\alpha\\), then we would expect them to converge.\n\n# Fit the model\nLR_reg = LogisticRegression()\nLR_reg.fit(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR_reg)\nplt.savefig('gradient_descent.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fit the model\nLR_stoch = LogisticRegression()\nLR_stoch.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 10)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR_stoch)\n\n\n\n\n\nnum_steps = len(LR_reg.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR_reg.loss_history, label = \"gradient\")\n\nnum_steps = len(LR_stoch.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR_stoch.loss_history, label = \"stochastic gradient\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nlegend = plt.legend() \n\n\n\n\nAfter running these methods, we see that the data was able to converge in both cases. We see that they both reach the same loss, but the stochastic gradient descent reaches it in fewer iterations, meaning it iterated over all data points less times. This may be because it makes updates to w more frequently than regular gradient descent does, since it samples its w on smaller portions of data set X and updates it appropriately.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important that the learning rate \\(\\alpha\\) is relatively small. Before we set our alpha to 0.1, but if we use the same data and set \\(\\alpha\\) to a too high number we will see that we never converge in both regular gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. If \\(\\alpha\\) too large, we might be updating w by too much such that it overshoots where the minimum actually is resulting in a flucuating loss history.\n\n# Fit the model\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = 170, max_epochs = 1000)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n/Users/katiemacalintal/Desktop/Machine Learning/KatieMacalintal.github.io/posts/optimization/logistic_regression.py:54: UserWarning: WARNING: Could not converge\n  warnings.warn(\"WARNING: Could not converge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 75, max_epochs = 1000, batch_size = 50)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n/Users/katiemacalintal/Desktop/Machine Learning/KatieMacalintal.github.io/posts/optimization/logistic_regression.py:119: UserWarning: WARNING: Could not converge\n  warnings.warn(\"WARNING: Could not converge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = 75, max_epochs = 1000)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\nThrough graphing the loss history, we see that it fluctuates greatly due to the large \\(\\alpha\\) size. We also see that because stochastic gradient descent updates w more often, our fit_stochastic doesn’t converge with a high learning rate that our regular gradient descent method can actually converge with.\n\n\n\nNow, we will run some experiments on how the batch size influences convergence. We will do this with a larger data set of 1000 points, which have 10 features.\n\n# Make the data\np_features = 11\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 1000, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\ndef graph_loss(LR):\n    fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 1)\n\n    axarr.plot(LR.loss_history)\n    axarr.set(xlabel = \"Iteration number\", ylabel = \"Empirical Risk\", title = f\"Loss = {LR.loss_history[-1]}\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n\nIn the Disenroth, Faisal, and Soon reading, they observe that “Large mini-batch sizes will provide accurate estimates of the gradient, reducing the variance in the parameter update. … The reduction in variance leads to more stable convergence, but each graident calculation will be more expensive” (232). On the other hand, they observe that “small mini-batches are quick to estimate. If we keep the mini-batch size small, the noise in our graident estimate will allow us to get out of some bad local optima” (232). We’ll conduct experiments such that our batch_size decreases in size, and we’ll inspect their loss to see how Disenroth, Faisal, and Soon’s observations hold.\n\nLR_500 = LogisticRegression()\nLR_500.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 500)\n\ngraph_loss(LR_500)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR_50 = LogisticRegression()\nLR_50.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 50)\n\ngraph_loss(LR_50)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR_25 = LogisticRegression()\nLR_25.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 25)\n\ngraph_loss(LR_25)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR_5 = LogisticRegression()\nLR_5.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 5)\n\ngraph_loss(LR_5)\n\n\n\n\n\nnum_steps = len(LR_500.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR_500.loss_history, label = \"batch size 500\")\n\nnum_steps = len(LR_50.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR_50.loss_history, label = \"batch size 50\")\n\nnum_steps = len(LR_25.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR_25.loss_history, label = \"batch size 25\")\n\nnum_steps = len(LR_5.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR_5.loss_history, label = \"batch size 5\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nlegend = plt.legend() \n\n\n\n\nWe see that as our batch size gets smaller, our number of iterations over the all data points in X also gets smaller. This relates to why stochastic gradient descent uses fewer iterations as gradient descent. If our batch size is large, we do not update w as frequently as we would have if it were smaller. Based on our loss graphs, we also see that, as noted by Disenroth, Faisal, and Soon, stochastic gradient descent with large batch sizes have a smooth convergence, and small batch sizes have a noiser convergence.\n\n\n\nIn the fit_stochastic function we also implemented the option to use momentum, which takes into account our previously taken step and allows us to continue moving along that direction if the update was good. In the case shown below, we see that momentum was able to result in less iterations over the data, but understanding when exactly momentum would significantly speed up convergence will require more experiments.\n\n# Make the data\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 500, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (0, 0)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 10, momentum = False)\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 10, momentum = True)\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)"

In this case, convergence is until the improvement in the our loss function is small enough in magnitiude.\nThe fit_stochastic function is very similar to the fit function, expect this time we don’t compute the complete gradient, we instead compute the gradient on a batch size.\n\n\n\nBefore we conduct any experiments, we need to import and define relevant extensions, classes, and functions.\n\nfrom logistic_regression import LogisticRegression # source code\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nnp.seterr(all='ignore') \n\ndef graph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR):\n    fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2)\n\n    axarr[0].scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\n    axarr[0].set(xlabel = \"Feature 1\", ylabel = \"Feature 2\", title = f\"Loss = {LR.loss_history[-1]}\")\n\n    f1 = np.linspace(-3, 3, 101)\n\n    p = axarr[0].plot(f1, (- LR.w[2] - f1*LR.w[0])/LR.w[1], color = \"black\")\n\n    axarr[1].plot(LR.loss_history)\n    axarr[1].set(xlabel = \"Iteration number\", ylabel = \"Empirical Risk\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\nWe first created a set of data with 2 features and see that their labels slightly overlaps with each other.\n\n# Make the data\np_features = 3\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 200, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can then fit this data using our fit method, which uses gradient descent, and fit_stochastic, which used batch gradient descent. When we give these fit methods a reasonable learning rate \\(\\alpha\\), then we would expect them to converge.\n\n# Fit the model\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fit the model\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 10)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\nAfter running these methods, we see that the data was able to converge in both cases. We see that they both reach the same loss, but the stochastic gradient descent reaches it in fewer iterations, meaning it iterated over all data points less times. This may be because it makes updates to w more frequently than regular gradient descent does, since it samples its w on smaller portions of data set X and updates as it goes.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important that the learning rate \\(\\alpha\\) is relatively small. Before we set our alpha to 0.1, but if we use the same data and set it to a too high number we will see that we never converge in both regular gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. If it’s too large, we might be updating w by too much such that it eventually skips over the minimum.\n\n# Fit the model\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = 125, max_epochs = 1000)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 50, max_epochs = 1000, batch_size = 50)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = 50, max_epochs = 1000)\n\ngraph_fit_and_loss(X, y, LR)\n\n\n\n\nWe see, however, that because stochastic gradient descent updates w more often depending on our batch_size, our fit_stochastic doesn’t converge with a high learning rate that our regular gradient descent method can converge with.\n\n\n\nNow, we will run some experiments on how the batch size influences convergence. We will do this with a larger data set that has 10 features.\n\n# Make the data\np_features = 11\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 1000, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\ndef graph_loss(LR):\n    fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 1)\n\n    axarr.plot(LR.loss_history)\n    axarr.set(xlabel = \"Iteration number\", ylabel = \"Empirical Risk\", title = f\"Loss = {LR.loss_history[-1]}\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n\nIn the Disenroth, Faisal, and Soon reading, they observe that “Large mini-batch sizes will provide accurate estimates of the gradient, reducing the variance in the parameter update. … The reduction in variance leads to more stable convergence, but each graident calculation will be more expensive” (232) On the other hand, they observe that “small mini-batches are quick to estimate. If we keep the mini-batch size small, the noise in our graident estimate will allow us to get out of some bad local optima” (232). We’ll conduct experiments such that our batch_size decreases in size, and we’ll inspect their loss to see how Disenroth, Faisal, and Soon’s observations hold.\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 500)\n\ngraph_loss(LR)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 50)\n\ngraph_loss(LR)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 25)\n\ngraph_loss(LR)\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, alpha = 0.1, max_epochs = 10000, batch_size = 5)\n\ngraph_loss(LR)\n\n\n\n\nWe see that as our batch size gets smaller, our number of iterations over the all data points in X also gets smaller. This relates to why stochastic gradient descent uses fewer iterations as gradient descent. As our batch size gets larger, we do not updates w as frequently as we would have if it were smaller. However, stochastic gradient descent with large batch sizes"

We can further inspect why this qualitative Island feature was chosen over Sex and Clutch Completion using functions like groupby and aggregate from the pandas package.\n\n\"\"\"\nResources: \nhttps://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.08-aggregation-and-grouping.html\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe-reset_index/\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/interesting-ways-to-select-pandas-dataframe-columns-b29b82bbfb33\nhttps://sites.ualberta.ca/~hadavand/DataAnalysis/notebooks/Reshaping_Pandas.html\n\"\"\"\n\n# Group the penguins by species and island, and count the number of occurrences\ncounts = train.groupby(['Species', 'Island']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\n# Group the penguins by island and compute the total count for each island\nisland_totals = counts.groupby('Island')['count'].sum().reset_index(name='total')\n\n# Merge the counts and island_totals\nresults = pd.merge(counts, island_totals, on='Island')\n\n# Compute the percentage\nresults['percentage'] = results['count'] / results['total'] * 100\n\n# Edit results dataframe so that it only contains the Island, Species and percentage\nresults = results[['Island', 'Species', 'percentage']]\n\n# Arrange results to have islands as columns and species as rows\nresults = results.pivot(index='Species', columns='Island', values='percentage').round(2)\n\nprint(results)\n\nIsland                                     Biscoe  Dream  Torgersen\nSpecies                                                            \nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)         25.74  42.27      100.0\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)     NaN  57.73        NaN\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)           74.26    NaN        NaN\n\n\n\ncounts = train.groupby(['Species', 'Sex']).size().reset_index(name='count')\nsex_totals = counts.groupby('Sex')['count'].sum().reset_index(name='total')\nresults = pd.merge(counts, sex_totals, on='Sex')\nresults['percentage'] = results['count'] / results['total'] * 100\nresults = results[['Sex', 'Species', 'percentage']]\nresults = results.pivot(index='Species', columns='Sex', values='percentage').round(2)\nresults = results.drop(columns='.')\n\nprint(results)\n\nSex                                        FEMALE   MALE\nSpecies                                                 \nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)         44.53  40.44\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)   22.66  19.85\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)           32.81  39.71\n\n\n\ncounts = train.groupby(['Species', 'Clutch Completion']).size().reset_index(name='count')\nclutch_totals = counts.groupby('Clutch Completion')['count'].sum().reset_index(name='total')\nresults = pd.merge(counts, clutch_totals, on='Clutch Completion')\nresults['percentage'] = results['count'] / results['total'] * 100\nresults = results[['Clutch Completion', 'Species', 'percentage']]\nresults = results.pivot(index='Species', columns='Clutch Completion', values='percentage').round(2)\n\nprint(results)\n\nClutch Completion                             No    Yes\nSpecies                                                \nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)        37.93  43.50\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)  37.93  18.29\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)          24.14  38.21\n\n\nWhen we inspect the qualitative features in this way, we see that each island has at most two different penguin species that live there. For the Sex and Clutch Completion features, however, we see that it’s harder to differentiate the species based on those values for it could be any of the three species.\nLooking back at our exhaustive search feature results, we also see, however, that it found a different pair of quantatative features with a higher sore. It found Culmen Depth (mm) and Culmen Length to be more useful features.\nTo figure out whether the SelectKBest Flipper Length (mm) and Culmen Length features or exhaustive search features Culmen Depth (mm) and Culmen Length (mm) are the better pair of quantitative features, let’s inspect what they look like when graphed using the seaborn package.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_theme()\n\nsns.relplot(\n    data=train,\n    x=\"Culmen Length (mm)\", y='Flipper Length (mm)', hue=\"Species\"\n).set(title = \"SelectKBest Features\")\n\nsns.relplot(\n    data=train,\n    x=\"Culmen Length (mm)\", y=\"Culmen Depth (mm)\", hue=\"Species\"\n).set(title = \"Exhaustive Search Features\")\n\n<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x157babbb0>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these graphs, it looks like Culmen Depth (mm) and Culmen Length (mm) may be the better quantative options for it looks like they have less overlap among their species. In other words, it’s more easily separable and distinguishable.\nTo summarize when training our models, we will use the quantitative Culmen Depth and Culmen Length features and qualitative Island feature."

    "text": "Implementation\nResource: Regression Notes\nAs discussed in this course, least-squares linear regression fits nicely into the friendly convex linear model framework. In our LinearRegression class, we implemented a linear predict function and a loss function that uses squared error, which is convex. By defining our predict and loss functions in these ways, we are then left with the empirical risk minimization problem of \\[\\hat{w}=\\underset{w}{\\arg\\min}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\langle{\\mathbf{w}}, {\\mathbf{x}}_i\\rangle - y_i)^{2}=\\underset{w}{\\arg\\min}\\left\\lVert\\mathbf{Xw}-\\mathbf{y}\\right\\rVert_2^2.\\]\nTo solve this empirical risk minimization problem, we first take gradient with respect to \\(\\hat{w}\\), which results in \\[\\nabla L(w)=\\mathbf{X}^T(\\mathbf{Xw}-\\mathbf{y}).\\]\nTo continue solving this empirical risk minimization problem and find \\(\\hat{w}\\), we implemented two different fit methods in our LinearRegression class: fit_analytic and fit_gradient.\nIn fit_analytic, we use a formula involving matrix inversion that is obtained by using the condition \\(\\nabla L(w)=0\\). This ultimately results in \\[\\hat{w}=(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\mathbf{y}\\] and the corresponding code np.linalg.inv(X_.T@X_)@X_.T@y for w.\nIn fit_gradient, we use gradient descent and update w until the change in loss is at its lowest. To compute our gradient descent, which is \\[\\nabla L(w)=\\mathbf{X}^T(\\mathbf{Xw}-\\mathbf{y}),\\] is a very expensive computation because \\(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\) has time complexity \\(O(np^2)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\\) has time complexity \\(O(np)\\). But since the gradient doesn’t depend on our current w we precompute \\(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\) as \\({P}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\\) as \\({q}\\). This allows our w update to only take \\(O(p^2)\\) time."

    "text": "Demo\nTo demonstrate that we’ve implemented the fit_analytic and fit_gradient functions of our LinearRegression class correctly, we can test it on a dataset that has 1 feature to easily visualize the problem and results. We first define relavant functions that will help us with this demo.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\ndef pad(X):\n    return np.append(X, np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), 1)\n\ndef LR_data(n_train = 100, n_val = 100, p_features = 1, noise = .1, w = None):\n    if w is None: \n        w = np.random.rand(p_features + 1) + .2\n    \n    X_train = np.random.rand(n_train, p_features)\n    y_train = pad(X_train)@w + noise*np.random.randn(n_train)\n\n    X_val = np.random.rand(n_val, p_features)\n    y_val = pad(X_val)@w + noise*np.random.randn(n_val)\n    \n    return X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val\n\nNext, we create our training and validation data, each of which have 100 data points and 1 feature.\n\nn_train = 100\nn_val = 100\np_features = 1\nnoise = 0.2\n\n# create some data\nX_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = LR_data(n_train, n_val, p_features, noise)\n\n# plot it\nfig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex = True, sharey = True)\naxarr[0].scatter(X_train, y_train)\naxarr[1].scatter(X_val, y_val)\nlabs = axarr[0].set(title = \"Training\", xlabel = \"x\", ylabel = \"y\")\nlabs = axarr[1].set(title = \"Validation\", xlabel = \"x\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\nNow we can start fitting our model using our implemented LinearRegression class. We first test out our fit_analytic function.\n\nfrom linear_regression import LinearRegression\n\nLR = LinearRegression()\nLR.fit_analytic(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(f\"Training score = {LR.score(pad(X_train), y_train).round(4)}\")\nprint(f\"Validation score = {LR.score(pad(X_val), y_val).round(4)}\")\n\nTraining score = 0.1464\nValidation score = 0.1548\n\n\nWhen we inspect our training and validation scores, we see that they may not be as high as the scores we would get on classification models in the past. This is because it all depends on the randomly generated data we get and how much noise is present in it. We can also inspect its estimated weight vector as shown below.\n\nLR.w\n\narray([0.31040324, 1.0968243 ])\n\n\nNext, we try testing out our fit_gradient function, and inspect its weight.\n\nLR2 = LinearRegression()\n\nLR2.fit_gradient(X_train, y_train, alpha = 0.01, max_iter = 1e3)\n\n\nLR2.w\n\narray([0.31041385, 1.09681821])\n\n\nWe see that its weight is pretty close to the weight calculated in our fit_analytic function. Since our fit_analytic keeps track of the scores of the current weight, we can also inspect its score_history.\n\nplt.plot(LR2.score_history)\nlabels = plt.gca().set(xlabel = \"Iteration\", ylabel = \"Score\")\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, we see the score increases monotonically in each iteration.\nBased on this demo, it looks like our LinearRegression class is working adequately."

When we inspect our evolution of validation scores, however, we see that as our number of features increases, our validation score decreases and eventually shoots down to a very low validation score.\nThis evolution of the training and validation scores follows the pattern of overfitting. Here, as the number of features increase, we see a gap between the training and validation score get larger. Perhaps this tells us that the more features we use with least squares linear regression the more vulnerable we are to overfitting."

Doing this gives us our feature matrix features, our label vector label, and group label vector group.\n\nPaymentProblem = BasicProblem(\n    features=features_to_use,\n    target='SAL50K',\n    target_transform=lambda x: x == 1,\n    group='SEX',\n    preprocess=lambda x: x,\n    postprocess=lambda x: np.nan_to_num(x, -1),\n)\n\nfeatures, label, group = PaymentProblem.df_to_numpy(acs_data)\n\nFinally, we perform a train-test split on the data.\n\n# Train/test split \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, group_train, group_test = train_test_split(\n    features, label, group, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n\n\n\n\nBefore we train our model, we are going to inspect any patterns we see in our training data.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X_train, columns = features_to_use)\ndf[\"SEX\"] = group_train\ndf[\">50K\"] = y_train\n\ndf.shape\n\n(70868, 18)\n\n\nBased on the dimensions of our df data frame, which holds all the feature values for every individual in our training data, we see that our training data has information for about 70868 different individuals.\nBased on the table below, we see that only about 31.21% of the individuals in our training data make more than $50K.\n\nmore_than_50K = df.groupby([\">50K\"]).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\nmore_than_50K['percent'] = (more_than_50K['count'] / len(df.index) * 100).round(2)\n\nmore_than_50K\n\n\n\n\nIncome Greater Than $50K\n  \n    \n      \n      >50K\n      count\n      percent\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      False\n      48752\n      68.79\n    \n    \n      1\n      True\n      22116\n      31.21\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nBased on the table below, we see that of those who make more than $50K in our training data, about 59% of them are male while the remaining 41% of them are female.\n\nfiltered_df = df[df['>50K'] == True]\n\nmore_than_50K_by_sex = filtered_df.groupby(['SEX']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\nmore_than_50K_by_sex['percent'] = (more_than_50K_by_sex['count'] / len(filtered_df.index) * 100).round(2)\n\nmore_than_50K_by_sex\n\n\n\n\nSex of Those with Income Greater Than $50K\n  \n    \n      \n      SEX\n      count\n      percent\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      13035\n      58.94\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      9081\n      41.06\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nBased on the two tables below, we see that about 38% of males and 25% of females have an income of more than $50K.\n\nfiltered_df = df[df['SEX'] == 1]\n\nmales = filtered_df.groupby(['>50K']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\nmales['percent'] = (males['count'] / len(filtered_df.index) * 100).round(2)\n\nmales\n\n\n\n\nMales with Income Greater Than $50K\n  \n    \n      \n      >50K\n      count\n      percent\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      False\n      21342\n      62.08\n    \n    \n      1\n      True\n      13035\n      37.92\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nfiltered_df = df[df['SEX'] == 2]\n\nfemales = filtered_df.groupby(['>50K']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\nfemales['percent'] = (females['count'] / len(filtered_df.index) * 100).round(2)\n\nfemales\n\n\n\n\nFemales with Income Greater Than $50K\n  \n    \n      \n      >50K\n      count\n      percent\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      False\n      27410\n      75.11\n    \n    \n      1\n      True\n      9081\n      24.89\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nOverall, based on these tables it looks like males are more likely to make more than $50K.\nWe can also inspect intersectional trends by studying the proportion of those who make more than $50K broken out by both our chosen group labels of SEX and an additional group label. Here we have chosen to use RAC1P.\nWe first create a data frame that holds that information and then use seaborn package to visualize the new data frame.\nRemember that …\n\nRAC1P is race (1 for White Alone, 2 for Black/African American alone, 3 for Native American alone, 4 for Alaska Native alone, 5 for Native American and Alaska Native tribes specified, 6 for Asian alone, 7 for Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, 8 for Some Other Race alone, 9 for Two or more races)\n\nSEX is binary sex (1 for male, 2 for female)\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Create new dataframe\nfiltered_df = df[df['>50K'] == 1]\nintersectionality = filtered_df.groupby(['SEX', 'RAC1P']).size().reset_index(name='count')\nintersectionality['Percent'] = (intersectionality['count'] / len(filtered_df.index) * 100).round(2)\n\n# Visualize it using seaborn package\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nsns.barplot(x=\"RAC1P\", y=\"Percent\", hue=\"SEX\", data=intersectionality).set(title='Percent with Income >$50 by SEX and RAC1P')\n\n[Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Percent with Income >$50 by SEX and RAC1P')]\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the bar plot above, we see that white men make up the majority of those who make more than $50K in our data, followed by white women. In our training data, we also see that individuals who are not white, regardless of their sex, make up a small portion of those who make more than $50K.\n\n\n\nNow it is time to train our model. The model we chose to use is the DecisionTreeClassifier, which requires a specified max_depth. To find our optimum max_depth we use cross validation.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n\nmax_score = 0\nbest_depth = 0\nfor d in range(2, 20):\n    T = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = d)\n    cv_mean = cross_val_score(T, X_train, y_train, cv = 10).mean()\n    ax.scatter(d, cv_mean, color = \"black\")\n    if cv_mean > max_score:\n        max_score = cv_mean \n        best_depth = d\n\nlabs = ax.set(xlabel = \"Complexity (depth)\", ylabel = \"Performance (score)\")\n\n\n\n\nFor our model, we create a pipeline with StandardScaler() and our DecisionTreeClassifier with the our found optimum max_depth.\n\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nDTC = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = best_depth)\nmodel = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), DTC)\n\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nPipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),\n                ('decisiontreeclassifier',\n                 DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=9))])In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook. On GitHub, the HTML representation is unable to render, please try loading this page with nbviewer.org.PipelinePipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),\n                ('decisiontreeclassifier',\n                 DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=9))])StandardScalerStandardScaler()DecisionTreeClassifierDecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=9)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that our model is trained, we can audit how it does on the test data. We first define a function that may help with finding the positive predictive values (PPV), which is the proportion of positive results that are truly positive, the false negative rate (FNR), and false positive rate (FPR). We also extract our predictions y_hat on the test data.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\ndef find_PPV_FNR_FPR(data, predictions):\n    confusion = confusion_matrix(data, predictions)\n    TP = confusion[1][1]\n    TN = confusion[0][0]\n    FP = confusion[0][1]\n    FN = confusion[1][0]\n    PPV = TP / (TP + FP)\n    print(f\"{PPV=}\")\n    FNR = FN / (FN + TP)\n    print(f\"{FNR=}\")\n    FPR = FP / (FP + TN)\n    print(f\"{FPR=}\")\n\n# Extract predictions \ny_hat = model.predict(X_test)\n\n\n\nNow we can examine the overall accuracy, PPV, FNR, and FPR from our model on our test data.\n\n# Overall accuracy \n(y_hat == y_test).mean()\n\n0.8211987809007789\n\n\n\nfind_PPV_FNR_FPR(y_test, y_hat)\n\nPPV=0.7009745255599248\nFNR=0.2571117956151477\nFPR=0.14337240757439135\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also examine the accuracy, PPV, FNR, and FPR for each subgroup in our test data. So examining group 1, is equivalent to examining these values for the males in the test data. And exmaining group 2, is equivalent to examining these values for the females in the test data.\n\n# Accuracy for men\n(y_hat == y_test)[group_test == 1].mean()\n\n0.8259855376720318\n\n\n\n# Accuracy for women \n(y_hat == y_test)[group_test == 2].mean()\n\n0.8167104111986002\n\n\n\n#PPV FNR and FPR for male\nfind_PPV_FNR_FPR(y_test[group_test == 1], y_hat[group_test == 1])\n\nPPV=0.7850098619329389\nFNR=0.2597644141351519\nFPR=0.12228870605833957\n\n\n\n#PPV FNR and FPR for female\nfind_PPV_FNR_FPR(y_test[group_test == 2], y_hat[group_test == 2])\n\nPPV=0.6099038118988244\nFNR=0.2533798517226341\nFPR=0.15983068165231354\n\n\nWe see that the accuracy of each group seem to be within a reasonable range of each other, but the PPV, FNR, and FPR differ slightly.\n\n\n\n\nBased on our work above and using the definition that calibration is where the PPV is the same for all groups in the data, it does not look like our model is calibrated. We see the males had a higher proportion of positively classified cases that were truly positive than the females.\nBased on the definition that error rate balance is where the FPR and FNR are the same for all groups, we see that our model does not have error rate balance. We see that FNR (predicting a negative label when it was actually positive) for males are slightly higher than the FNR for females. We also see that the FPR (predicting a positive label when it was actually negative) for males are lower than the FPR for females. Our model does not make the same mistakes for each group at the same rate. This is very interesting results based our basic descriptive of our training data where we found that females were a smaller proportion of those who made more than $50K.\nBased on the definition that statistical parity is where the PPVs are similar, we also see that our model does not satisfy statistical parity.\n\n\n\nUltimately, we feel that our model would not be fit to be deployed in the real world.\nA model like this, that predicts income labels, might be beneficial to companies that try to function in conditions where income is not explicitly disclosed, but is useful. Companies might use a model like this to be more strategic with who to advertise towards. If the brand is expensive, they might aim to advertise more towards those who have a higher income. A model like this may also be used in more serious conditions that can greatly affect someone’s way of living. Government programs that aim to assist lower income individuals may use this model to predict whether who is most in need of their help. It might also help determine who qualifies for loans, insurance, or credit cards.\nBased on our bias audit, our model seems to display all types of problematic bias. Because our model is not callibrated, the rates at which positively classified cases that are truly positive are not the same for each sex. More specifically, we see the males had a higher proportion of positively classified cases that were truly positive than the females. Because our model does not have error rate balance, it does not make the same mistakes for each group at the same rate. More specifically, we see that the rate for predicting a negative label when it was actually positive for males are slightly higher than the rate for females. We also see that the rate for predicting a positive label when it was actually negative for males are lower than the rate for females.\nDue to the results of our bias audit, our model could negatively impact males and females depending on the context in which it may be applied. For government programs that look to assist lower income individuals, this model may incorrectly predict that females make more than they do, denying them help they might really need. For loans, insurance, or credit cards, the model might predict that males make lower than they actually do, denying them these services that can make a difference in their life. We would not be comfortable releasing these models until the results of the bias audit are improved.\nBeyond bias, I think that this model may be making decisions about an individual without taking their full picture into account. When a model like this has to make big decisions related to loans, credit cards, insurance or government assistance, I think that there should be another person overlooking the models decisions to help regulate and assess the bias in the model. I also think that the individuals this model may be evaluating should have a say before a decision is made on their behalf. For example, if an individual is applying to a government program for assistance, they should be able to talk with those who make decisions to share more information about their story and better inform why they may need assistance. Ultimately, I think that it’s still important to incorporate people into these decision making processes."
